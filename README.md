# Aleup Project: https://www.aleup.fi/ (front-end)

A website synthesizing products that are on sale at the markets. When users visit my website, they can find answers to questions like these:
How many products are on sale now?
- Which market is on sale for those products?
- Which products are having the most discounts?
- Where can I search for a product and can see which markets are offering it on sale?
- Can I compare the price of the product I'm interested in if there are multiple markets discounting the product?
- Can I directly access the product on the marketplace website for more information or to shop online?
- Can I get an email (or message) notification of the products I'm interested in when they get a discount?
- Can I pay online through this website if I choose to buy many products from many different markets? (Currently, I have to go to the specific website of each market and pay for that market. If this website is an intermediary payment channel then great)

to find the answers to the above questions except for question 7 and 8 (these features may be updated in the future)

## Benefit of project could bring to a client:
Client will have a useful tool to see or search for discounted product, compare the price of that item. Instead of having to go to each market website to see or read daily newspaper ads. When market prices are easily searched and compared, markets will offer discounts to compete. This means that client benefit.
